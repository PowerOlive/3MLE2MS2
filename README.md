# 3MLE2MS2
3MLE MML to MS2MML converter

## What does it do?
Converts between 3ML Extended Music Macro Language (3MLE MML) and MapleStory 2 MML. Nice! 
Should be helpful for music enthusiasts and composers alike when copying your songs back and forth.

## Is it tested (yet)?
Yes (for MML playback component) and no (for literally everything else). Use at your own risk.

## Why don't you test it? It's easy right?
Yes, but running unit tests in JS/React is annoying and tedious and I really hate myself for using JS.
