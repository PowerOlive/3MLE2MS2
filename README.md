Convert seamlessly between 3MLE Music Macro Language and MapleStory 2 MML formats from an easy-to-use web app.

## What does it do?
Converts between 3ML Extended Music Macro Language (3MLE MML) and MapleStory 2 MML. Nice! 
Should be helpful for music enthusiasts and composers alike when copying your songs back and forth.

## Is it tested (yet)?
Yes (for MML playback component and note parsing) and no (for literally everything else). I feel like it's relatively stable to use now, since I've fixed most of the stupid parsing bugs, however *__use this at your own risk__*.

## Why don't you test it? It's easy right?
Yes, but running unit tests in JS/React is annoying and tedious and I really hate myself for using JS.

## You want to include this in your own project?
Probably will work on documentation/refactoring soon, but follow general package hierarchy to find the major components (playback, form, and utils)

## FAQ
### Please, I want (feature x) in your tool, pretty pleeeeease
Ok, you can help me out by outlining what I could do to implement it in the Issues tab above, which doubles as a feature request submission

### It doesn't work!!!! Your tool sucks!!!
Sorry

### Why is your tool always offline whenever I need to use it?
This is a good question. I try to keep uptime as much as possible, but due to random unforeseen events (like your brand new motherboard exploding on you), this may not always happen. Also, I tend to come back to my projects and "fix" them, creating more issues.
