# How to contribute

1. This is a Create React App project. Please do not eject it (unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL reason to do so)
2. Keep the codebase as clean as possible. Refactoring and bugfix work takes precedence over feature requests.
3. We use the fork model for making contributions. Make a fork, work downstream, and make a PR here that links to your downstream work.
4. No contribution is a bad contribution (unless you're blatantly trolling). I'll give code reviews to each PR + I'll concede to whoever writes better code.
